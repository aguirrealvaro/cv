        As a frontend developer with more than 4 years of experience working with React and
        TypeScript, and backend skills using Node, I enjoy creating digital products that
        provide a great user experience, consistency, and follow best practices. I believe in
        writing clean and efficient code that&apos;s easy to maintain and scale. I am always
        willing to learn and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies
